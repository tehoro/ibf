INSTRUCTIONS

You have been presented with a directory called originalcode

This has two subdirectories in it - one is webforecasts which is code for setup and running of routine
forecasts by called an API based at replit.  The controlling file is config.json.

The other directory is the full contents of an app that runs at replit and can be called using an API
to fetch ECMWF ensemble data from open-meteo.com and do lots of work including calling an LLM to create and return forecast text

I want to refactor this all into one complete Python program - completely modularised rather than
in this rather complex form with some files which are very long

From the very beginning I would like this to be set up to be hosted on github (private for now) in such a way that
a rather noin-technical user can install it on their own machine (be that macOS< windows or Linux).

It should use the uv method of creating a virtual environment in which all teh requirements including which python we 
are using can be installed

When the system is run the parameter should include the particular config.json file as an argument to the run
do this can maybe be run to schedule as a cron job or similar, for different configuration files

At the moment, a separate setup.py is run to set up the web structure for the various location and area forecasts
I would like this to be automatically done every time the program is run instead, in case the config file changes
or else there may be some kind of system that recognises the config file is different and the other files need creating
Or something.

Replit uses Secrets for the API Keys and so on.  These should be stored in whatever is the most appropriate way to do this
for a github repository - e.g., in a .env file or something.  Again, there needs to be clear instructions to the user about how to do that.

These are the secrets currently used:
