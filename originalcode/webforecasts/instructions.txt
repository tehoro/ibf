 want to set up a system that does teh following:

(1) it is based on a single folder on my computer.
(2) It has a control file which includes a list of locations for which forecasts will be made, as well as a list of (local) times that forecasts should be produced.  This should be one control file and the information can be in json format or something (a bit like a plist) that I can edit in plain text.  The locations should include to start with, at least "Auckland, NZ and Otaki, NZ", and the times for forecasts to be produced should include at least 5:30 am and 8:30 pm.
(3) In the web server directory, which is hosted at //Volumes/synology/web/weather/forecasts there will be a web page with a map of NZ on which are superimposed clickable names of the locations (no "NZ needed - so for instance there would be the text "Auckland" at or beside the location on Auckland on the map.  So we need to create an index.html file for that, which includes some sort of map as I have described.  There will need to be one setup python program that creates this index.html file and the links and also a series of subdirectories within that folder for each forecast.  Each subdirectory will have a name such as "aucklandnz" in case we ever want to go beyond just nz locations for this.  And we want people to be able to bookmark a web page where the forecast just for their location is listed.
(4) Inside each directory there will need to be some sort of simple web page (index.html) which has a nice heading saying something like forecast for <<location>> - I will provide more interesting text later.
(5) There will be a separate python program that will need to run on a schedule to produce these forecasts - based on the schedule in teh control file.  So the step python program should set up that schedule (and may also need to delete any previous one if it exists) to dun this program.
(6) That separate program will produce forecast texts to be put into the appropriate directory for each location.  It will call an API for each location of the form

https://open-meteo-ensemble-forecast-text-neilgordon.replit.app/forecast?location=Auckland%20NZ so it needs to URL encode any spaces.  The text that is returned from the API call will be of the following form 

[{"latitude":-40.7603,"location":"Otaki NZ","longitude":175.1577,"text_forecast":"**THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING, WEDNESDAY 9 APRIL:** It looks like a lovely clear afternoon and evening ahead. Temperatures reached about 15C this afternoon and will fall steadily this evening. Winds were westerly around 10 km/h but will become light and variable tonight, settling to easterly 10 km/h later. The low tonight will be between 10C and 11C.\n\n**TOMORROW, THURSDAY 10 APRIL:** Expect a fine and sunny day right through. Winds will start as easterlies around 10 to 20 km/h overnight and through the morning, then shift to a northwesterly 10 to 20 km/h during the afternoon and evening, possibly gusting to 30 km/h at times. The low will be near 10C, and the high should reach about 18C.\n\n**FRIDAY 11 APRIL:** There's some uncertainty for Friday. Most likely it will be a mainly fine day, starting clear and seeing cloud increase later on. However, a few different outcomes show some light rain developing, possibly in the afternoon or evening, or perhaps overnight into the morning for some scenarios. Winds will start northeasterly 10 km/h, becoming northwesterly 10 to 20 km/h during the day, potentially gusting 30 to 40 km/h in some outcomes, before easing and turning westerly later. The low is expected between 11C and 13C, with the high near 18C. There's roughly a 20% chance of seeing rain, likely just 1 to 2 mm if it occurs, though one scenario suggests up to 3 mm.\n\n**SATURDAY 12 APRIL:** Saturday's weather is quite uncertain, with very different possibilities. The most likely outcome is a fine day with mainly clear skies. However, there's a notable chance of rain, especially overnight or in the morning. Most scenarios predicting rain suggest only light amounts, around 1 to 2 mm, although one suggests up to 15 mm. Critically, there is one less likely scenario that predicts persistent moderate to heavy rain throughout the day, potentially bringing over 50 mm, which would be a significantly wetter day. Winds are also variable depending on the outcome; fine weather likely brings westerlies turning southerly 10 km/h, while the very wet scenario involves strengthening southeasterlies up to 30 km/h. The low will likely be between 11C and 13C (cooler if it stays clear), and the high around 17C to 18C (cooler if it's very wet). There's a 40% chance of precipitation, with likely amounts between 1 mm and 15 mm, but be aware of that small possibility for much heavier rain.\n\n**SUNDAY 13 APRIL:** Looking mostly fine for Sunday with clear or mainly clear skies expected for most of the day. A few scenarios might see some light rain, mainly overnight or early morning, possibly returning late evening in one outcome. Winds are expected to be mainly easterly or southeasterly, generally 10 to 20 km/h, but could become stronger, possibly 30 km/h with gusts to 40 or 50 km/h in some scenarios, especially later in the day. The low temperature has a wide range of possibilities, from 9C to 15C depending on overnight cloud cover. The high should be between 18C and 20C. There's a 30% chance of rain, likely totalling 1 to 3 mm if it happens.\n\n**MONDAY 14 APRIL:** Another day with some differing possibilities, though leaning towards fine. Many outcomes suggest a fine day with sunshine, perhaps some cloud later. However, several scenarios bring periods of rain, mostly light, possibly during the afternoon or evening, or maybe around midday. One scenario includes moderate rain patches. Winds look variable, often starting easterly or northeasterly 10-20 km/h, shifting northwesterly 10-30 km/h during the day with gusts up to 50 km/h possible, before potentially turning westerly or southwesterly later. The low is expected between 11C and 14C, and the high around 18C to 19C (though a couple of scenarios reach 20-21C). There's a 45% chance of rain, likely 1 to 4 mm, but one scenario suggests heavier falls totalling 16 mm are possible.\n\n**TUESDAY 15 APRIL:** Confidence is higher for rain on Tuesday, although a few scenarios suggest it could stay dry. Most outcomes predict rain, ranging from light showers to periods of moderate rain, most likely during the morning and afternoon, possibly clearing later for some. Winds are expected to become southerly or southwesterly for most, generally 10 to 20 km/h, but potentially strengthening to 30 to 40 km/h with gusts of 50 to 60 km/h in the wetter scenarios. The low will likely be between 10C and 13C, and the high between 16C and 18C (cooler if it's wetter and windier). There's a 70% chance of rain, with totals likely between 3 mm and 8 mm, though a couple of scenarios could see up to 11 mm."}]

When that text is returned, it should be used to update the forecast in the appropriate directory for that location.  I'm not sure whether it is simplest to do that by just writing a new version of the index.html file in that directory, or my overwriting some other text file within the directory that contains the forecast as opposed to static information.  Your call.

Please ask if you have any questions, otherwise you can now start to produce three files for me:

* the configuration file
* the setup.py file
* the make_forecasts.py file that runs to the schedule
