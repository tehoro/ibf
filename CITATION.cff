abstract: >
  IBF is an open-source toolkit for generating plain-language,
  impact-based weather forecasts from numerical weather prediction
  model output. The system integrates ensemble or deterministic model
  data with large language models to produce consistent, readable
  forecast narratives, optionally enriched with alert information
  and local impact context. IBF is designed for human-in-the-loop
  forecasting workflows and operational experimentation in forecast
  communication.
